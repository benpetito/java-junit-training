Introduction to unit testing in Java with JUnit.

Tests are introduced through exercises, with progressive exercises on different branches.

Training files are located in the `org.training` package. Source classes can be found under `src/main/java` and test classes are located in `src/test/java`.

## Prerequisites

* knowledge of Java
* knowledge of using Git (checkout, switch branch)
* a Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc)

## Setup

This training is created as a Maven project. Check out this repository to somewhere on your local drive and use your IDE to import the repository as a Maven project.

In Eclipse, this can be performed using File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects.
